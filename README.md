# tnd-vaccine-effectiveness

Users can run all the analyses within the main.R script in the R folder.

Users can run portions of the main.R files to see BLCM for evaluating Vaccine Effectiveness in Test-Negative Design (TND). 

In the [R](R) folder there are the following scripts (tasks):
- [functions.R](R/functions.R) (for simulating data under different scenarios of test(s) accuracy, vaccine effectiveness, sample size.
- [models.R](R/models.R) (Bayesian models for 1 imperfect test and Bayesian Latent Class Models for two imperfect tests).
- [simulations_1t.R](R/simulations_1t.R) (for running simulations with 1 imperfect test)
- [real-world-application.R](R/real-world-application.R) (code for real world example)

In the [tfls](tfls) folder users can find summaries/plots of simulations
